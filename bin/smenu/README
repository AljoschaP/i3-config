smenu
=====
A simple wrapper around dmenu which remembers your last
choices and displays them in front of the menu. Its similiar
to xboomx [1] but its written in Go and is not another wrapper
around dmenu_path and dmenu_run. It has its own cache file
and stores the names of the executable together with the
number of calls as plain text.

Installation
------------

Install suckless-tools to obtain dmenu. On a Debian like system something
like

 $ apt-get install suckless-tools

will do. To build smenu you need to have a Go 1.x (x >= 1) compiler available.
See [2] how to get one. 

   $ go get bitbucket.org/s_l_teichmann/smenu

And place the resulting executable 'smenu' in your PATH-.

Development setup:

    $ hg clone https://s_l_teichmann@bitbucket.org/s_l_teichmann/smenu
    $ cd smenu
    $ go build 

To use it e.g with i3wm add following line to your ~/.i3/config:

    bindsym $mod+d exec smenu

To pass options to the call of dmenu can be just appended them
after a '--'. So 'smenu -- -b -l 10' will result in a call of 'dmenu -b -l 10'.
With the '-d' flag yo can specify a custom demu executable.
This is e.g. needed if you have a HiDPI display and the standard
font rendering is too tiny. Using the XFT patch [3] helps.
In this case your binding may look like:

   bindsym $mod+d exec smenu -d '/home/user/bin/dmenu' -- -fn DejaVuSansMono-10

How does it work?
-----------------
smenu generates a list of executable files
in your PATH. They are stored in a cache file in ~/.smenu_cache. Each entry
in this file has counter how often the executable is called from smenu.
The most frequently called executable are on the top of the list
an therefore lead the list processed by dmenu. After calling of dmenu
the position of the selected entry is updated in ~/.smenu_cache
according to its increased counter.
